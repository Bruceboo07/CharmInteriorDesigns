Charm Interior Designs — Ready-to-deploy (React + Vite + Tailwind)

What I prepared for you:
- A Vite + React project with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion.
- SEO meta tags and example portfolio, live projects, testimonials and a contact form.
- Replace FORM_ENDPOINT in src/App.jsx with your Formspree form endpoint (free) or any form handler.
- Replace the WhatsApp number in src/App.jsx with your real number.

How to deploy to GitHub + Vercel (quick):
1. Unzip this archive on your computer.
2. Open a terminal in the project folder.
3. Run: npm install
4. (Optional local preview) run: npm run dev
5. Commit the folder to a new GitHub repo (root must contain package.json).
6. In Vercel: Import project from GitHub, Framework = Vite, Build = npm run build, Output = dist.
7. Deploy. Vercel will build and publish automatically.

If you want, I can push this to a GitHub repo for you (I will provide the ZIP here for you to upload).
